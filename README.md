# Professors and Universities

## Spatial distribution of professors' qualification sites

The present project is intended to uncover the broader diatopic distribution of CAU's professors' cities of qualification along with the respective scientific discipline.

Data is assembled on the basis of the [digital professoriate index by Volbehr/Weyl 1956](https://digihum.de/professoren/) and supplementary information drawn from linked knowledge bases e.g. [German National Library catalogue](https://www.dnb.de/DE/Home/home_node.html), [Virtual International Authority File](https://viaf.org/), [Worldcat Identities](https://www.worldcat.org/identities/) etc. and other relevant print sources.

The resulting cartographic representation shall provide
a macro view on the geographic provenience of CAU's professors
and associated global areas of research.
